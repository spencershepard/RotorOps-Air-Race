# RotorOps Air Race
 Simple DCS air race script.  Works in single, multiplayer or dedicated server.

 Gates are trigger zones that MUST be named like 'GATE-1', 'GATE-2' etc

 Players should be client aircraft with matching group and pilot names like 'P1', 'P2', etc as defined in the script. 

 Trigger zones with colors in their names will activate smoke markers continually (for marking the gates).  ie 'GREEN', 'RED', 'WHITE', 'BLUE', 'ORANGE'.

 See the included mission for how to set up the script loading and triggers (very simple).
